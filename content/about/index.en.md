Hi, I'm Jack.

A senior software engineer currently focused on building fast, low latency reporting systems in C that help people make sense of large amounts of data in real time.

Here are some of the languages and technologies I have experience with:

- C  
- C++  
- Python  
- Verilog  
- VHDL  
- Go
- (Plus some I probably missed) 
<br>

This website is dedicated to technology stuff I do outside of work.
