Hey,

It has been a while since I last posted on my personal blog so I thought I would start fresh with my blog to allow myself to share interests that I enjoy working on in my personal time.

# A Little Recap About Myself

I am still working in software, I currently work on creating low latency reporting systems using the C programming language. I enjoy working on backend/low level projects in my spare time revolving around a multitude of different architectures. Some projects I enjoy working on are:

- **FPGA development** (currently using Ultra96V2)
- **Homelabbing** (Currently running a self build 3D printed nas)
- **AI on edge** (mostly around Apple Intelligence)
- **PCB design**
- **CAD Design**
- **3D Printing**
